- The robust individual may gradually embrace more remote overtones of the harmonic series
- But the frail individual, both young and old, but mostly old, will not be in position to abide the remote overtones
- Hence the name of the most acclaimed Coen Brothers movie

# Rug, Hat, Case

In "No Country for Old Men," both the novel by Cormac McCarthy and the film adaptation by the Coen Brothers, the fate of the case containing $1 million is somewhat ambiguous but leans towards grim outcomes. Llewelyn Moss, who initially finds the case at the scene of a drug deal gone wrong, ends up being killed. The case then changes hands several times under violent circumstances.

By the end of the story, it's implied that the merciless antagonist, Anton Chigurh, ends up with the case after retrieving it from a hotel room, although this is shown more explicitly in the film than in the book. The book leaves more to the readerâ€™s interpretation but suggests a similar outcome. Chigurh, who operates on a strict moral code that often involves deciding others' fates with a coin toss, seems to escape with the money, maintaining his pattern of evading law enforcement and leaving a trail of violence behind.
