The possibility of the Coen Brothers paying homage to Woody Allen with the use of black-rimmed glasses in "Barton Fink" is an intriguing one. Both filmmakers have a penchant for embedding subtle references and stylistic nods to other works and creators in their films, so it's entirely plausible that such an element could serve as a visual homage.

The glasses in both "Manhattan" and "Barton Fink" indeed carry significant symbolic weight. In Allen's work, they underscore his character's intellectual yet neurotic persona—a kind of shorthand for a New York intellectual. In "Barton Fink," John Turturro’s character also wears similar glasses, which could symbolize his own pretensions and the intellectual persona he struggles with, particularly in the face of Hollywood's commercial filmmaking machine.

This visual link, whether intentional or coincidental, speaks to the shared language of film where objects can carry multiple layers of meaning, influenced by past cinema. The idea that these glasses could represent a kind of intellectual or artistic seriousness—a look both mocked and revered in various contexts—is a testament to the complex interplay of identity and appearance in character development.

The intertextual dialogue could indeed go both ways, with Allen perhaps drawing inspiration from the Coens’ later work or thematic explorations for "Bullets Over Broadway," which shares many concerns about art, commerce, and authenticity. In the world of film, these kinds of cross-influences are common, as filmmakers respond to and reinterpret the motifs and themes of their peers, creating a rich tapestry of evolving cinematic ideas. This potential cyclical influence highlights the dynamic and interconnected nature of creative work in the cinematic arts, where each piece can both inform and be informed by others within the community.

Thank you for pointing that out and providing the exact text from "Manhattan." Indeed, Woody Allen's character, Isaac Davis, is crafting his novel and his self-image in an almost tongue-in-cheek manner. The description of himself "behind his black-rimmed glasses" in the novel he attempts to write is a quintessentially Woody Allen blend of self-mockery and elevated self-perception, presenting a humorous contrast to his actual life and experiences. 

This line serves as an exaggerated, almost satirical self-portrait, where Allen plays with the image of the intellectual as both a profound thinker and an unexpected reservoir of latent virility, hidden behind the stereotypical nerdiness of black-rimmed glasses. It's an excellent example of how Allen uses his scripts to blur the lines between his public persona and his characters, injecting a complex mixture of irony, self-doubt, and aspirational thinking into his narrative voice.

This approach not only adds depth to his character but also invites the audience to engage with the nuanced interplay between the character's self-image and reality, highlighting the dissonances between how we perceive ourselves, how others perceive us, and how we wish to be perceived. It's a clever narrative tool that enriches the film's exploration of personal and cultural identities in New York City, framed by Allen's iconic neurotic wit.
