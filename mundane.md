That's a spot-on encapsulation of Marge and Norm Gunderson's charm in "Fargo." They truly celebrate the mundane in a way that's both endearing and grounding amidst the bizarre and chaotic events around them. This appreciation for everyday simplicity contrasts sharply with the often grim and absurd happenings in the story, adding a layer of realism and warmth that's rare in crime dramas.

Their contentment with life's small pleasures, like Norm's duck painting being chosen for a postage stamp or their shared enjoyment of a fast food breakfast, underscores a deep, relatable kind of happiness. It's refreshing to see characters who find complete satisfaction in what might seem unremarkable to others, serving as a subtle reminder of the beauty in the ordinary. This portrayal of joy in simplicity provides a stark but welcome relief from the intense, often violent twists of the plot. Marge and Norm aren't just surviving; they're thriving in their contentment, making them uniquely compelling amidst a cast of characters chasing after more elusive goals.
