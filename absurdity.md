- Anchors against existential drift:
   - Dude's rug
   - Tom's hat
   - Llewyln's case
   - Tamino's flute
   - Papagino's birds
   - Both: Tamina & Papagina
   - Fink's type writer
   - Don Giovani's license
 
- Disproportionate efforts to recover these look absurd to the viewer
   - Rug & hat
   - But many viewers may empathize with Llewyln's case of $1m
   - Money's symbolism is not personal or idiosyncratic since it can purchase other symbols and comforts
