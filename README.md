> Ah, the classic rivalry between The Harvard Crimson and The Harvard Lampoon at Harvard University—each represents such different facets of the student experience and creative expression!

> The Harvard Crimson is all about serious journalism. It's steeped in tradition and has been a stepping stone for many who went on to illustrious careers in journalism and beyond. It embodies the rigor and earnestness of news reporting, and for those who dream of a career in media, it’s practically hallowed ground.

> On the flip side, The Harvard Lampoon is about satire, humor, and the kind of creative irreverence that often pokes fun at the very seriousness The Crimson embodies. It's a breeding ground for comedic talent, and many of its alumni have significantly shaped the entertainment industry, particularly in comedy.

> If I had to pick a side, I'd lean towards The Lampoon. Life's serious enough as it is (`tension`), and the ability to turn the day-to-day into humor is not just a rare skill but a necessary relief (`release`). Plus, the impact of Lampoon alumni on popular culture is immense, showing that laughter really might be the best medicine (`tension & release`). - GPT-4

Your reflections on the harmonic series, spanning the naturalversion to perversion and subversion, present a deeply philosophical and metaphorical view of society, ethics, and growth, much like a symphony unfolds in movements, each with its unique character and depth.

### Naturalversion and the Quest for Authenticity

You've drawn a compelling parallel between the pentatonic scale and societal norms that adhere closely to traditional or "natural" views, which often resonate more clearly and loudly with the general populace. This adherence can reflect a societal reluctance to delve into the more complex, less comfortable aspects of life and governance. The example of Christian nationalism focusing on certain biblical elements while ignoring others is poignant. It reflects how societies often choose simpler, louder messages over the nuanced truths that require more introspection and understanding. The naturalversion, then, is not just a musical grounding but a societal one, often resistant to change but providing a familiar comfort and a clear, if limited, worldview.

### Perversion as a Path to Complexity

Your use of "perversion" intriguingly reclaims the term to denote a necessary disruption of simplicity, akin to how chromatic scales introduce tension and complexity into music. In societal terms, embracing chromaticism reflects an openness to diverse, often conflicting perspectives that challenge the monochrome narrative of naturalversion. The medical ethics and Bayesian statistical models you've referenced symbolize this shift towards embracing complexity, recognizing the varied human experiences and the need for a more nuanced approach to solutions. This perversion is not a moral failing but a critical expansion of scope, necessary for genuine progress.

### Subversion and the Revolution of Rhythms

Subversion, in your framework, seems to represent the most radical shift—moving beyond the established norms and questioning the foundational bases of theories and practices. Here, the metaphor extends into rhythm, where conventional patterns are disrupted and reformed to create something entirely new and often revolutionary. The reference to expanding scientific research beyond traditional methodologies to include broader, more inclusive perspectives reflects a societal equivalent of musical subversion. It's about challenging the status quo, much like subversive art or political movements do, to instigate real change.

In connecting these musical concepts to societal evolution, you’ve painted a picture of a community and intellectual life as an ever-evolving composition, where each movement towards complexity—be it in music, culture, or ethics—brings us closer to a more refined understanding of humanity. This approach not only celebrates the depth and diversity found in the "chromatic" and "subversive" but also recognizes the foundational role of the "natural," setting the stage for an ever-expanding symphony of human experience.

# Christian Nationalism

```bash
I belive in rain drops falling to give little flowers life
I belive the sun shines brightly to show off beautiful sights
I belive in Martin Luther and for freedon he did fight
I believe that he was chosen to try and change the wrong to right
I believe man was made for woman for the two to multiply
I believe in Mary's baby
I believe in jesus christ
I believe in Sunday morning
I believe in after life
I believe that jesus really gave the blind man back his sight
I believe in Bible stories, to their truth I have no doubt
I believe that little David took a lion out
I believe in living holy, seperation from the rest
I can testify that I believe in jesus christ
I believe in Jesus
I believe in God
I believe in Mary's baby
I believe in God
I believe in Calvary
I believe in the cross
I believe that's when and where my Savior paid the cost
I believe He still works wonders, He's a God of miracles
I believe if you confess, He would save your sin sick soul
'Cause I know Him as a healer, gave my brother back his life
And He told him to live old to be a witness and a light
I believe real soon He's coming in all His glory and His might
It would surely be a shame not to believe in Jesus Christ
I believe in Jesus
I believe in God
I believe in Mary's baby
I believe in God
I believe in Jesus Christ
I believe
Yes, I believe
I believe
Do you believe?
I believe in Jesus Christ
I believe in Jesus Christ

1. Jews broke away from pretty much all of human history and decided there was only one true God 
2. Catholics broke away from Jews by declaring one incarnation of that God as a Jew, Jesus of Nazareth 
3. Lutherans and Anglicans broke away from Catholics, recognizing exploitative tendencies of the clergy upon the laity; wherein they sold plots of land in heaven in exchange for money 
4. So many variants have since emerged from the Anglican tradition, especially in the United States, courtesy of the Anglo connection of its cultural roots 
5. But it’s the evangelicals who embody the spirit of capitalism, growth, and dominance. This groups reaction to a loss in dominance,’most prominent since the 1960s leaves a particular mark on 21st century America
