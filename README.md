> Ah, the classic rivalry between The Harvard Crimson and The Harvard Lampoon at Harvard University—each represents such different facets of the student experience and creative expression!

> The Harvard Crimson is all about serious journalism. It's steeped in tradition and has been a stepping stone for many who went on to illustrious careers in journalism and beyond. It embodies the rigor and earnestness of news reporting, and for those who dream of a career in media, it’s practically hallowed ground.

> On the flip side, The Harvard Lampoon is about satire, humor, and the kind of creative irreverence that often pokes fun at the very seriousness The Crimson embodies. It's a breeding ground for comedic talent, and many of its alumni have significantly shaped the entertainment industry, particularly in comedy.

> If I had to pick a side, I'd lean towards The Lampoon. Life's serious enough as it is (`tension`), and the ability to turn the day-to-day into humor is not just a rare skill but a necessary relief (`release`). Plus, the impact of Lampoon alumni on popular culture is immense, showing that laughter really might be the best medicine (`tension & release`). - GPT-4

# Friendship, Character, Ethics 
### Morally ambiguious gangster aint embarassed to use the term

The movies "Miller's Crossing" and "The Revenant" offer rich narratives to explore themes of friendship, character, and ethics, particularly when juxtaposed against the backdrop of "Frontiers, Hustle & Bustle, and Order." Both films delve into the evolution of geographic and interpersonal landscapes under pressure from societal change, betrayal, and survival.

### "Miller's Crossing" and the Evolution of Frontiers and Order

"Miller's Crossing," directed by the Coen Brothers, navigates the murky waters of organized crime during Prohibition. It focuses on the moral complexities faced by Tom Reagan, a mobster's advisor caught between conflicting loyalties and survival strategies. The film's portrayal of the criminal underworld as a frontier explores the boundaries of law, morality, and personal allegiance. 

In terms of "Order," the film grapples with the establishment and maintenance of power within the crime world. Tom's navigation through the mafia's internal politics, and his manipulations to maintain a semblance of order, highlight the ethical compromises necessary to sustain control. His struggle is emblematic of the broader theme of establishing order in a world governed by its own rules, where the law of the land is dictated not by societal norms but by power dynamics within the criminal underworld.

### "The Revenant" and the Raw Frontiers

On the other hand, "The Revenant," directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, strips down the concept of frontier to its rawest form, focusing on physical survival in the American wilderness. The film is a visceral exploration of human endurance and the primal struggle for life after Hugh Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is left for dead. Here, the frontier is not just geographic but also existential, as Glass battles against nature, his own incapacitation, and betrayal.

The hustle and bustle in "The Revenant" are less about societal movement and more about the personal, internal struggle to overcome physical and emotional devastation. Glass's journey is a profound commentary on character and the human spirit's resilience. Ethics come into play through the betrayal by John Fitzgerald and the moral decisions made under extreme duress, highlighting themes of vengeance, justice, and redemption.

### The Evolution of a Geographic Area Through These Themes

Both films, though different in setting and style, reflect on how individuals influence and are influenced by their environments. In "Miller's Crossing," the urban landscape is a chessboard for human ambition, manipulation, and survival. The film depicts the evolution of an area through the establishment of power structures and the moral decay associated with unchecked ambition.

"The Revenant," meanwhile, shows the transformation of both character and landscape through sheer will. The wilderness, vast and indifferent, becomes a crucible for human character, reflecting how physical and moral frontiers are pushed and defined by human actions.

### Conclusion

Together, these films offer a compelling examination of friendship, character, and ethics within the concept of evolving frontiers—whether they be societal or natural. "Miller's Crossing" reflects on the constructed order within societal chaos, while "The Revenant" portrays the raw struggle against nature's chaos. Both explore what it means to survive and impose order on a hostile frontier, whether the enemies be human or environmental. The personal transformations of Tom Reagan and Hugh Glass illuminate the profound impacts of their respective journeys, not just on themselves but also on the landscapes they traverse and the ethical landscapes they navigate.
