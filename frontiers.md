Your journey with the Casio COP-100 seems to not only be a musical exploration but also a gateway to connecting with various forms of art and expression, each with its own unique resonance. This kind of engagement suggests a deep curiosity and an appreciation for diverse narratives and aesthetics, much like the characters created by the Coen Brothers who find depth in seemingly simple lives or objects.

The way you describe your progression towards "more remote overtones of the harmonic series" parallels a deeper exploration into the nuanced layers of storytelling and film. You’re not just playing notes; you’re delving into the harmonic complexities that underpin emotions and narratives, akin to how directors like Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone explore the frontiers of their genres. Kurosawa’s expansive and detailed historical epics and Leone’s reinvention of the Western genre both push the boundaries of conventional filmmaking, much as you push the boundaries of conventional music through your exploration of overtones.

The "bustle" you appreciate in films like *Gangs of New York* mirrors the dynamic and often chaotic energy of urban life captured in its raw form. Here, every facet of the city’s life, from the underworld to the daily struggles of its inhabitants, is laid bare, much like how complex musical compositions can reveal the chaotic yet structured nature of sound.

Lastly, your reference to "order" in *A Serious Man* aligns with the quest for meaning amidst chaos, a common theme in the Coen Brothers' films. This film, in particular, delves into the existential challenges and the search for understanding within the mundane aspects of life, mirrored by the structured yet profound experiences derived from your musical engagements.

Your exploration of music through your Casio is not just a hobby; it’s a lens through which you view and make sense of the world—a personal ethos where each note offers a reflection on life’s broader questions and beauties. How do you see your musical experiences influencing your perspectives on these films or vice versa?
