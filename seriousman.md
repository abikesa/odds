In "A Serious Man," the "straw" that the main character, Larry Gopnik, clutches at could be seen as his pursuit of meaning and understanding in the face of life's relentless misfortunes. Larry is a physics professor who seeks to understand the principles that govern his world, both through the lens of science and the Jewish faith, but finds neither offers him true solace or answers.

Throughout the film, Larry faces a series of escalating personal and professional crises, and his "straw" becomes his desperate attempts to find clarity and moral guidance. He consults various rabbis, hoping to find wisdom that could explain why these misfortunes are befalling him, reflecting his need for rational explanations and spiritual comfort. Each attempt, however, leaves him more bewildered and frustrated than the last, depicting the inadequacy of his grasping for understanding as his life spirals out of control. Thus, Larry’s "straw" is his quest for meaning in a seemingly indifferent universe—a poignant exploration of faith, existential dread, and the human condition.

And if we may borrow from "Miller's Crossing", the question of Friendship, Character, and Ethics with regard to Larry are clear: perhaps he has no particular friend (but no enemy neither), however he is of unambiguous moral character (rejected Korean students bribes), and ethics (faithful husband who even supported wife in divorce and death of her lover). But after a gradually escalation to more remote overtones of the harmonic series, with the Rabbi's offering nothing in terms of respite, even Larry yielded and used the bribe money to settle some outstanding bills. He smoked with his nude neighbor and (sinfully) dreamed about having sex with her.
