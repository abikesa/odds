Steve Buscemi's `character` in this scenario is a quintessential example of how greed and mistrust can escalate into fatal outcomes, even among criminals who are partners in crime. The scene you're describing evokes the gritty, tension-filled atmosphere often found in films like those directed by the Coen Brothers, where Buscemi often shines as the weaselly, scheming `character`.

His character’s insistence on arguing over the car, despite already having secretly stashed away a vast sum, highlights a profound irony and moral to the story: even surrounded by wealth, greed can blind individuals to rational choices and lead to their undoing. The argument over something as comparatively minor as the car, in the face of the larger hidden fortune, underscores a fundamental flaw in his `character`'s perception of risk versus reward. 

Buscemi often plays these types of `character`s who, despite their cunning and street smarts, are ultimately undone by their own hubris or greed. This scene not only serves as a pivotal moment for the `character` but also acts as a broader commentary on human nature and the destructive power of greed. It’s these thematic undercurrents, combined with Buscemi’s skillful portrayal, that make his `character`s so memorable and a critical study of flawed human motivations.
